            Hello, my name is Derick Fuentes. 
            I was born on October 31st, 2002 in Ottawa, Ontario. 
            My favorite kind of drink would always be a classic H<sub>2</sub>O. 
            On June 10<sup>th</sup> 2005, I discovered a hobby in video games. 
            I would also play some sports such as <strong>Soccer, Football, and Basketball</strong>
        </p>

            People tend to ask me where I would see myself in a few years.
             I see myself with a nice house and a loving family that I could have for my own.
             I always loved to fantasize about myself having <abbr title="self contained underwater breating apparatus">SUPER POWERS</abbr> simply because I could just fly around the world
